# Location Live API

![Location Live Server](https://cronitor.io/badges/CXVC5V/production/lj7XI3q8kEFSho9eq3rZBEPIZBc.svg)

This repo represents the backend interface of the [Location Live](https://rexgarland.dev/app/location-live/) mobile app,
allowing users to provide their own, custom backend for increased security and privacy.

Any backend that passes the contract defined here will work with the mobile app.

## Structure

The repo provides two things:

- a wrapper for calling a Location Live server: `api.ts`
- a simple contract to ensure that custom backends implement the correct behavior: `contract.ts`

## Usage

You can test any server url with the following:

```shell
npm run testServer -- <server-url>
```

For example:

```txt
>> npm run testServer -- https://locationlive.rexgarland.dev
âœ… Server is up.
âœ… Server can receive location updates.
âœ… Server can send location updates.
âœ… Server prevents one user from editing another user's location (aka spoofing).
âœ… Location updates include correct timestamps.
ðŸŽ¯ Complete!
```

## Testing

This contract itself is tested by ensuring a known-good server passes, and a known-bad server fails.
It's a basic sanity check, which you can run for yourself:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Contributing

The main goal is portability:

- All the code built to /dist should be runnable in the browser, node, or react native, for example.
- This package is imported by the mobile app to run an on-device healthcheck.
- It avoids unnecessary dependencies which may fail to load/run in a new environment.
